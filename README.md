# HarrisJT's Random Quote Machine

This is a random quote generator that will show a different quote when the New Quote button is clicked or spacebar is pressed. You can also share the quote on twitter, tumblr, or search it in google.

My first time using gulp, api's and json. Project from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine)
